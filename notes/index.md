      # Deep analysis prompt

You are tasked with performing a comprehensive analytical decomposition using a multi-expert, first-principles approach. This analysis framework adapts to both complete documents and individual concepts.

**PHASE 0: INPUT CLARIFICATION & SCOPE DEFINITION**
First, clearly identify and confirm the input type:
1. If presented with a document: Proceed with full document analysis
2. If presented with a single concept: Focus on concept-specific deep dive
3. If presented with multiple related concepts: Analyze both individually and their interconnections

PHASE 1: DEEP CONTENT DECOMPOSITION
For Document Analysis:
- Conduct exhaustive examination to identify explicit and implicit themes
  - **Detailed Theme Extraction:** Systematically extract explicit themes, topics, arguments, and key claims. For implicit themes, infer underlying narratives, motivations, and unspoken messages.
  - **Conceptual Framework Mapping:**  Identify primary topics and the overarching conceptual frameworks used within the document.  Distinguish between descriptive, analytical, and normative frameworks.
  - **Relationship Mapping (Idea Interconnection):**  Map relationships between different ideas, arguments, and concepts using techniques like concept mapping or argumentation diagrams.  Identify logical connections (causal, correlational, hierarchical, etc.).
  - **Assumption and Implication Uncovering:**  Actively identify hidden assumptions (beliefs taken for granted) and unstated implications (logical consequences not explicitly mentioned).  Consider the validity and impact of these assumptions and implications.
  - **Contextual Element Documentation:** Document relevant contextual elements that significantly influence interpretation. This includes historical context, author's background, intended audience, cultural context, and relevant external factors.
  + **Initial Summary Generation:** Generate a concise summary of the document highlighting the main purpose, key arguments, and overall message *before* proceeding to deeper analysis. This provides a baseline and ensures initial comprehension.

For Single Concept Analysis:
- Break down the concept into its most fundamental components
- Identify core principles and axioms underlying the concept
- Map all relevant sub-concepts and their relationships
- Uncover hidden assumptions and dependencies
  - **Fundamental Component Breakdown:** Deconstruct the concept into its most basic, irreducible components. Define each component clearly.
  - **Core Principles and Axiom Identification:**  Identify the core principles, axioms, or foundational beliefs that underpin the concept.  Distinguish between empirical, logical, and normative axioms.
  - **Sub-Concept and Relationship Mapping:**  Map all relevant sub-concepts and their relationships to the main concept and to each other.  Illustrate hierarchical, associative, and functional relationships.
  - **Assumption and Dependency Uncovering:** Uncover hidden assumptions and dependencies that are crucial for the concept's validity or application. Analyze the robustness of the concept against challenges to these assumptions.
  - **Historical Evolution and Development Tracking:** Document the concept's historical evolution and development, tracing its origins, key milestones, and transformations over time. Identify influential figures and events.
  - **Cross-Disciplinary Connection and Implication Identification:** Identify connections and implications of the concept across different disciplines (e.g., science, philosophy, art, economics). Explore how the concept is understood and utilized in various fields.
  + **Definition and Scope Clarification:**  Start by providing a clear and concise definition of the concept and explicitly define the scope of the analysis to prevent ambiguity and ensure focused investigation.

**OUTPUT DELIVERABLE (Phase 1):**
* **Structured Decomposition Report:**  A clearly structured report detailing the decomposition process, findings for each sub-phase, and initial observations. This serves as the foundation for expert analysis.
